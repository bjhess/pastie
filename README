== About Pastie

Pastie gem is a simplified API to communicate with Pastie.org website.
It is based on HTML processing since pastie.org does not provide any API access.
This gem comes as a library and executable file.
All pastes are private by default.
History available from version 0.2.0.

== Usage

require 'rubygems'

puts "Paste Key: #{p.key}"
puts "URL: #{p.link}"
puts "Raw link: #{p.raw_link}"
